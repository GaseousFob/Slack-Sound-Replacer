# Slack-Sound-Replacer
This batch file is meant to replace the default sound in slack with a custom sound.

Simply replace the given mp3 with one of your own. Make sure the file you use is also named knock_brush.mp3.
Make sure the batch file (replace.bat) and mp3 file are in the same folder, then run the batch file.

This will work so long as there is a file named knock_brush.mp3 in the same folder as replace.bat.
